## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps challenge, I'm learning about a complete CI/CD pipeline that takes code from commit to production, gaining practical DevOps skills that are in high demand across the tech and cloud industry. By the end of the 7 days, I will know about : 

- [How to set up Web App Environment in the Cloud](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/blob/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/01%20-%20Set%20Up%20a%20Web%20App%20in%20the%20Cloud/Set%20Up%20a%20Web%20App%20in%20the%20Cloud.md) 
- [Connect a GitHub Repo with AWS](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/blob/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/02%20-%20Connect%20a%20Github%20Repo%20with%20AWS/Connect%20a%20GitHub%20Repo%20with%20AWS.md)
- [Store Dependencies in CodeArtifact](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/blob/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/03%20-%20Store%20Dependecies%20in%20CodeArtifact/03%20-%20Store%20Dependencies%20in%20CodeArtifact.md)
- [Package an App with CodeBuild](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/blob/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/04%20-%20Contionus%20Integration%20with%20Codebuild/Contionus%20Integration%20with%20CodeBuild.md)
- [Deploy an App with CodeDeploy](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/blob/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/05%20-%20Deploy%20a%20Web%20App%20with%20CodeDeploy/Deploy%20a%20Web%20App%20With%20CodeDeploy.md)
- [Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/blob/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/06%20-%20Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20with%20CloudFormation/IAC%20with%20CloudFormation.md)
- [CI/CD with CodePipeline](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/7-Days-Devops-Challange/tree/198d44080b142a6a9f061e2b8b5e0ac416dbd178/07%20-%20Build%20a%20CICD%20Pipeline%20with%20AWS)

## Final Capstone Project

This challenge culminates in a final capstone project where I apply all the skills learned to build a robust, automated CI/CD environment. You can find the detailed implementation and source code for the capstone project in the following repository:

**Capstone Repository:** [nextwork-web-project](https://github.com/ngurahgdewisnugk/nextwork-web-project.git)

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 2-3 hours per day maybe more for a week to work on this challenge. I will ensure that I am fully responsible for completing this project. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be a short trip to a destination of my career path.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software. 

DevOps engineers implement these practices in an organization to optimize the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), making it faster and more reliable. They achieve this by building automated pipelines, containerizing applications, and turning cloud infrastructure into code

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. This process helps teams automate the flow of code changes from development to a live application, making it efficient and reliable. It involves: 

1. Setting up a Development environment.
2. Storing code in a source repository like GitHub and managing dependencies in a package repository like CodeArtifact.
3. Continuous Integration, where code is automatically built and tested (e.g., with CodeBuild) whenever changes are made.
4. Continuous Delivery, where the successfully built code is automatically deployed to a live application (e.g., with CodeDeploy).
Defining infrastructure as code (e.g., with CloudFormation) to automate environment setup.
